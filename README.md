# Booky API

Goal: simple rest API to create bookmarks with url, content, and tags (maybe personal notes).


## Connect to azure

See [Deployment](./Deployment/README.md)

## Connecting to AWS

> NOTE: opting to *not* go with AWS. The steps would be something as below.
> I believe the analogue for AWS is [elastic beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/dotnet-core-tutorial.html).
> Or just creating a docker image and deploying via a container.
